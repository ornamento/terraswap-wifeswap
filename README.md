## Get the Luna:bLuna exchange rate on Terraswap

A few notes:

1. Currently, after the auto announcement at 5%+, the bot goes to sleep for 10min or so to avoid spam

2. This is the skeleton for an auto-swapper bot, it's just missing the actual wallet and swap, which can be added by anyone wanting to create a bot or extend this one. 

3. It simulates a swap tx every .6 seconds (to avoid overloading the API). Since it's still simulating more than 1 tx per second, it's highly unlikely that by the time you manually go on Terraswap the swap rate will be as high as announced by the bot.

4. TG commands:
  /swap simulates a tx and gives current Luna:bLuna swap rate
  /info gives some basic info about the bot's functionality:
  
          Hallo!
          I'm a simple bot.

          You can use '/swap' to get the current Luna:bLuna exchange rate on Terraswap.
          I will also alert everybody automatically when the swap rate is greater than 5% in either direction.

          NOTES
          1. My rates do not take either tx commission (it's always ~0.003%), nor slippage into account â€“ the swap simulation on Terraswap doesn't return     slippage/minimum received. So, although the given spread is not exactly the one a real swap would have, it serves as a rough estimate!
          2. High swap rates are usually very short-lasting, often under a minute. I'm constantly simulating swaps on Terraswap to get the current exchange rate, so please don't blame me if the rate is lower by the time you make it to Terraswap!
